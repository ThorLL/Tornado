# 🌪️ Tornado Simulation

TornadoSim is a high-performance, physically-inspired tornado simulation. It models tornado dynamics with environmental factors like temperature, dew point, wind, and various atmospheric physics coefficients.

## 🌀 Tornado Dynamics
- Temperature & Dew Point determine core funnel pressure.
- Wind shear shifts the tornado position dynamically over time.
- Pressure deficit and core radius define the tornado’s suction effect on particles.
- Particle lift simulates the vertical pull inside the vortex.
- Environmental wind and drag affect horizontal movement.
